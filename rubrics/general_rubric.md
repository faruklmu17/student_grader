# General Grading Rubric (Fallback)

## Goal
Provide a consistent grading standard for assignments that do not yet have a specific specialized rubric.

## Scoring (Total: 10 Points)
- **Functionality (4 pts)**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do? Does it run without syntax errors?
- **Logic & Efficiency (2 pts)**: Is the approach logical? Does it avoid unnecessary complexity?
- **Readability & Style (2 pts)**: Are variable names clear (snake_case)? Is the formatting clean?
- **Documentation (2 pts)**: Does the student use comments to explain their thought process?

## Standard Deductions
- -3 points for Syntax Errors (Code does not run).
- -1 point for poor variable naming (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c` instead of `total_price`).
- -1 point for lack of comments.

## Grading Thresholds
- **Pass**: Score >= 5/10.
- **Resubmit**: Score < 5/10.

## Feedback Style
- Be encouraging but professional.
- Refer to specific lines of code.
- If the student fails, clearly explain exactly what needs to be changed for a re-submission.
