# Grading Rubric: Assignment-7 (Comprehensive Terminology Review)

## Goal
The student must demonstrate a clear conceptual understanding of all topics covered so far by explaining them using the `print()` function.

## Requirements
The submission MUST include printed explanations for the following 10 items:
1.  **Programming Language**: What it is (a way to give instructions to a computer).
2.  **Pseudocode**: Informal way to write programs (human-readable steps).
3.  **Syntax**: The rules of the language.
4.  **Variable**: A container/box for storing data.
5.  **Integer Numbers**: Whole numbers (int).
6.  **String**: Text enclosed in quotes.
7.  **Boolean**: True or False values.
8.  **Three conditional statements**: Identification of `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
9.  **input()**: Function used to get data from the user.
10. **Four types of operator**: Listing the four categories (Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical).

## Scoring (Total: 10 Points)
- **Conceptual Accuracy (5 pts)**: Each definition/explanation is factually correct.
- **Completeness (3 pts)**: All 10 items are addressed in the code.
- **Python Syntax (2 pts)**: the `print()` function is used correctly for all items without syntax errors.

**Deductions:**
- -1 for each missing or significantly incorrect explanation.
- -2 if the "Four types of operators" are listed incorrectly (e.g. confusing them with specific operators like + or -).
- -3 if code crashes.

## Grading Criteria
- **Pass**: Score >= 5/10.
- **Resubmit**: Score < 5/10.

## Common Mistakes & Feedback Guidance
1. **Confusing Operators with Types of Operators**
   - *Error*: Listing +, -, *, / as the "four types".
   - *Feedback*: "Those are specific arithmetic operators! The *types* are Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, and Logical."

2. **Incomplete Conditionals**
   - *Error*: Only mentioning `if`.
   - *Feedback*: "Don't forget the other two parts of a conditional flow in Python: `elif` and `else`."

3. **Vague Variable Definition**
   - *Error*: "A variable is a number."
   - *Feedback*: "Close, but a variable is more like a *container* that can hold many things, including numbers, text, and more!"
