# 6. Variable Naming Rules
# - Must start with a letter or underscore
# - Cannot start with a number
# - Case sensitive (age, Age and AGE are different)
# - Cannot contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# - Cannot be a Python keyword

# 7. The Assignment Operator
# The '=' sign is the assignment operator. 
# It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
x = 5 # Assigns 5 to x
